## Why RSS?

Why did we chose RSS as primary input?

- **Standardized Input**: RSS feeds are an universal data source.
- **Flexible Sources**: You can consume existing feeds directly from publishers or employ `rssbridge` to generate feeds from any HTML website.
- **Optimized Content**: We provide `rssbridge` configuration examples. Generating custom feeds via scraping is often superior to official feeds, as it enables the exclusion of paywalled or irrelevant content.
