# News Deframer

News Deframer will detect journalistic neutrality and framing in news articles. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), it analyzes the headlines and bodies.

It is implemented as dual use. It can act as an RSS Feed Proxy or as a browser plugin for RSS feed items to provide a "framing score" and context, helping users decide if an article is worth reading or if it is heavily biased.
